        <h2 class="bio-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
          Welcome! My name is Abhi Vishwas, and for years, I have been immersered in the beatiful culture of Silicon Valley, and am constantly inspired by those who revolutionize thinking and how we act. 
          As a student in UCR's Business Administration program, I am now constantly looking to apply forward focused management practices in combination with expertise in technology. Now with some tenure in the field with 
          internships and various projects under my belt, I realize that these very technologies have a very powerful way of bringing us together, requiring steady overview and critical insight to manage. 
          To bolster these efforts and to outfit my understanding of the points mentioned, I have spent the bulk of my career introducing myself to new philosopies, passions, and some of the projects that I would like to share with you here

      <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
      <p>
        Real Estate Agent, Code Ninja, Project Manager, Property Manager. In my life, I've been called a variety of things due to the extent of experimentation I have done.
        However, my favorite thing to be called is always a 'smiler'. Bringing positive and encouraging attitudes into my environments help me to make more effective decsions, 
        and help everyone to accomplish more. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the business side, I am currently a Business Administration major concentrating in Managment. I have applied these lessons
        through case studies, journals, and projects, even winning an award for a Case Competition in an Organization Behavior class recently
        I enjoy challenging myself, and due to this, I have recently aquired a Real Estate Liscene, and am actively looking for ways to expand my community. 
        Similarly I hope to supplement this with various certifications such as the CPM exam, Broker's Liscensing, and continue to practice entreprenuership
        within any industry I enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the technical side, I have been a student of CS and the IT industry nearly since I could walk. With my first steps being in 
        Web Dec, specifically HTML5, CSS3 , and JS, I learned to make a variety of projects, even this website! After that, my interests
        took me towards Object Oriented programming, with Java being the first on the list. Here, I took the AP CS class which 
        developed fundamentals like Recursion and Algorithims. During this time, I came to become the leader of a weekly club 
        known as Tri-Valley Coder Dojo, making me in charge of the teaching of Scratch, Python, JS, and other langauges, to kids K-12.
        I picked up cybersecurity on windows with pen-testing, but my favorite oppurtunity was CCIC in Southern California, a cyber-forensics
        competition where we picked up a win for our team back home! Now, I am interested in machine learning and XR developement, and also am actively
        looking to refresh and relearn these concepts where needed. In the future, I hope to create sustainable and elegant solutions that are able to 
        create impacts in my community.
